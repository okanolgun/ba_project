# ba_project

It is a Data Science Job Simulation of British Airways company. 

I had 2 different tasks in this project, which I participated in through The Forage. 

The first was to extract data from a user experience site, check customer experiences, and draw good or bad results. 

The second was a task in which I trained this data with different models, made a prediction and reported them with power point files. 

I added the necessary documents.
